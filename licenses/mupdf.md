# MuPDF and the libraries it is built with (desktop app)

pdit's desktop app edits text with **MuPDF** (D-065), built from source by the `mupdf-sys` 0.8.0 crate with its
`html` and `base14-fonts` features, through the `mupdf` 0.8.0 crate (patched copy in `third_party/mupdf-rs`).

## MuPDF, the mupdf crates, jbig2dec, the URW base-14 fonts (AGPL-3.0)

MuPDF © Artifex Software, Inc. (https://mupdf.com), mupdf-rs © its authors (https://github.com/messense/mupdf-rs),
jbig2dec © Artifex Software, Inc., and the URW++ base-14 fonts as distributed with MuPDF: all under the GNU Affero
General Public License version 3, the same licence as pdit — see [../LICENSE](../LICENSE).

FREETYPE LICENSES
-----------------

The FreeType  2 font  engine is  copyrighted work  and cannot  be used
legally without  a software  license.  In order  to make  this project
usable to  a vast majority of  developers, we distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose  *one* of the two licenses described
below, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License,  found in the file  `docs/FTL.TXT`, which is
    similar to the  original BSD license *with*  an advertising clause
    that forces  you to explicitly  cite the FreeType project  in your
    product's  documentation.  All  details are  in the  license file.
    This license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General
    Public License.

    Note that  this license  is compatible to  the GNU  General Public
    License version 3, but not version 2.

  - The   GNU   General   Public   License   version   2,   found   in
    `docs/GPLv2.TXT`  (any  later  version  can  be  used  also),  for
    programs  which  already  use  the  GPL.  Note  that  the  FTL  is
    incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause.

The contributed  BDF and PCF  drivers come  with a license  similar to
that  of the  X Window  System.   It is  compatible to  the above  two
licenses (see files `src/bdf/README`  and `src/pcf/README`).  The same
holds   for   the   source    code   files   `src/base/fthash.c`   and
`include/freetype/internal/fthash.h`; they were part of the BDF driver
in earlier FreeType versions.

The gzip  module uses the  zlib license (see  `src/gzip/zlib.h`) which
too is compatible to the above two licenses.

The files `src/autofit/ft-hb.c` and `src/autofit/ft-hb.h` contain code
taken almost  verbatim from the  HarfBuzz file `hb-ft.cc`,  which uses
the 'Old MIT' license, compatible to the above two licenses.

The  MD5 checksum  support  (only used  for  debugging in  development
builds) is in the public domain.
